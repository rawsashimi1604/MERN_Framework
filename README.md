# MERN Framework

## About
This is a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React/Vue, NodeJS) boiler plate framework I have created to get started on my demo projects easily.

## Installation
Create a new `.env` file in the main directory. This will store your MongoDB Atlas secrets.

Paste your secret key like below, then save your file.
```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>!@<your database URL>/<your collection name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Run `npm install` to install all related dependencies in `package.json`

## Run
Execute `npm run watch` to get the server up and running.

## Technologies
- MongoDB Atlas (Cloud) / Mongoose
